      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a senior at the University of Michigan studying Data Science and Mathematics. 
        I'm passionate about computer graphics, systems engineering, robotics, and linear algebra.
        <br>
        <br>
        On campus, I'm a member of the Autonomous Robotics Vehicle Team,
        where I focus on path planning algorithms and autonomous navigation.
        I’m also involved with Michigan Computer Graphics,
        where I explore topics ranging from ray marching to rasterization.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my free time, I’m building a voxel engine from scratch using Rust and wgpu,
        combining my interests in graphics, linear algebra, and systems programming.
        I also study Japanese language and culture, and had the opportunity to study abroad in Japan during the summer of 2024.
        Language learning has been a rewarding challenge that helps me approach problem-solving from new perspectives.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Voxel Engine:</strong> Building a real-time voxel engine using Rust and wgpu, featuring GPU-accelerated rendering and efficient chunk-based world management. Focused on performance and parallelism to handle dynamic terrain and lighting in an interactive 3D environment. </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Ray Tracer:</strong> Built a high-fidelity ray tracer in Rust using object-oriented design and advanced linear algebra to simulate realistic graphics features like anti-aliasing, reflections, and refraction across various materials.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Sharded Paxos Database:</strong> Developed a fault-tolerant Paxos-based consensus library in Go, using idiomatic Go techniques such as goroutines and channels for concurrency. Integrated with a sharded key-value store to maintain reliability across simulated machine and replica group failures.</li>
      </ul>
